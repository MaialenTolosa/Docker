This is a Flask-based web application developed for an academic project that demonstrates web development, data processing, and visualization skills. It features multiple routes, uses Redis to track page visits via environment variables, and leverages Pandas to load and display the first 5 rows of the Titanic dataset as an HTML table. Additionally, a bar chart visualizes the number of male and female survivors. The app includes static and template handling, is Dockerized for deployment, and follows a clean, modular project structure.
